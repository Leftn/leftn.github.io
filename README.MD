# Raider.IO Histogram/Percentile Ranks

Just a small project to display all character's raider.io score in a
meaningful way.

There is a histogram + a small table of common percentile breakpoints.

---

You can also input your own rating to find out which percentile you are at.

---

The only addition planned for this is to automate generation of the index.html
file when new data is collected.

---

All data is collected from the raider.io API using the non-public endpoints

The public API can be found here: https://raider.io/api
